name: chaos
description: "Claim-led multi-agent deliberation for high-stakes judgments that direct verification cannot settle. Use only when the user explicitly requests CHAOS, council/debate, structured disagreement, adversarial or claim audit, minority report, stress-test, or evidence-standard synthesis. Unasked, never launch; only propose it when a decision is simultaneously hard to reverse, costly if wrong, and not directly verifiable. Work directly for document/diff review, lookup, calculation, routine edits, brainstorming, or anything one agent can verify."

# CHAOS

Use CHAOS to make a judgment that verification cannot settle survive
independent search and adversarial criticism. The parent remains judge and
final writer; advisers run as native subagents or fresh agent sessions.

## Gate

CHAOS is off by default, and loading this skill is not a decision to run it.
Launch adviser runs only when the user asked for a deliberation mode by name.
Unasked, the strongest case — a judgment hard to reverse, costly if wrong, and
beyond direct verification, all three — buys a one-sentence proposal to the
user, never a launch. Felt importance buys nothing: a task is not promoted to
deliberation by mattering. Reading, reviewing, or assessing a document, diff,
or answer is one reader's direct work, whatever its stakes, unless the user
asked for independent review. When in doubt, work directly; when direct work
exposes a genuinely contested claim, that is the moment to propose escalation
— cheap to offer, and the user decides. The gate also applies inside a run:
any claim a cheap direct check can settle is settled by the check;
deliberation handles only what verification cannot reach.

## Modes after the gate

Choose a deliberation mode only after the gate admits CHAOS.

| Mode | Use when |
|---|---|
| Skip/direct | Reading or assessing a document, diff, or answer; simple lookup; deterministic calculation; routine work; raw divergent ideation; or tightly coupled work better solved by direct verification. |
| Claim audit | An existing answer, plan, proposal, document, claim set, or diff needs claim-led stress testing or focused refutation before decision. |
| Council | Broad ambiguous decision or high-stakes research/design needs independent same-question first positions. |
| Review loop | An implementation or artifact needs parent-controlled writing plus fresh independent review. |

For full recipes, escalation, and stop rules, read
[references/protocols.md](references/protocols.md). Before choosing models, read
[MODEL_USAGE.md](MODEL_USAGE.md); project-local `MODEL_USAGE.md` overrides this
default.

## Core workflow

1. **Frame.** Fill the task frame from
   [references/artifact-schemas.md](references/artifact-schemas.md): question,
   scope, evidence standard, success criterion, mode, stop rule, perspectives,
   model/provider trust boundary, and artifact destination. State the question
   neutrally — advisers never see the user's leaning or the parent's preferred
   answer.
2. **Separate.** Apply the expansion rule in `references/protocols.md`: explicit
   exhaustive CHAOS uses all suitable approved routes; every other activation
   starts with the smallest sufficient independent set and expands only for a
   missing decision-relevant axis. Discover the host's execution capabilities,
   then launch each route as a native subagent when that backend satisfies the
   isolation contract, otherwise as a fresh agent session. Start first positions
   in parallel when possible; if the host can only serialize isolated sessions,
   keep prior outputs hidden and record `serial-isolated`. Collect every first
   position before any adviser sees peer answers. Every Council first-position
   adviser answers the same whole frame and names the strongest alternative it
   rejected; topic-sharded research is scouting only.
3. **Externalize.** Convert positions into claims, assumptions, evidence,
   confidence basis, uncertainty, and risks.
4. **Cross-examine.** The parent mediates: anonymize memos by diversity axis,
   forward only evidence-bearing critiques in `claim → evidence → consequence →
   requested change` form, drop rhetoric.
5. **Revise.** Defend, narrow, correct, merge, concede, withdraw, or preserve
   dissent. A reversal citing no new evidence is conformity, not correction; the
   parent discounts it.
6. **Synthesize.** The parent normalizes claims and writes the final answer
   against the frame. Agreement counts are never truth; unanimous first
   positions trigger a diversity-failure check, not a conclusion.
7. **Record.** For nontrivial runs, keep a claim ledger. Save substantial
   outputs in the runtime's artifact directory or an OS temporary directory by
   default; write them into the project only when the user asks for durable
   artifacts. Verify files exist. For a failed perspective, inspect execution
   and authoritative output first; retry once only under the failure rules in
   `references/orchestration.md`, otherwise record the degraded perspective.
   Code claims require locatable evidence: `file:line`, diff hunk, test output,
   command output, or stable permalink.

## Output contract

Return: decision or answer; surviving claims with support;
changed/narrowed/rejected/merged/withdrawn claims; live objections or minority
report; uncertainty and validation still needed; failed/degraded perspectives;
and why the synthesis follows from the frame. If the evidence standard is unmet,
return `unresolved after exhaustive available review`, `needs direct test`,
`needs external expertise`, or `insufficient evidence`. Use
[references/artifact-schemas.md](references/artifact-schemas.md) for durable
artifact shapes.

## References and final check

Use references by need:
[references/orchestration.md](references/orchestration.md) before multi-agent
launch, artifact handling, failure handling, or review-loop coordination;
[references/adviser-prompts.md](references/adviser-prompts.md) when writing
agent prompts;
[references/evaluation-rubric.md](references/evaluation-rubric.md) before final
synthesis; [references/philosophy.md](references/philosophy.md) only when
modifying the skill or resolving protocol-design ambiguity.

Before finishing, confirm: frame explicit and neutral; every Council first
position answered the whole frame with no scouting shard counted as one; ledger
present when nontrivial; critiques anonymized, evidence-bearing, and targeted at
claim IDs; reversals cite the evidence that changed them; parent synthesis not
majority rule; dissent and validation gaps recorded.
