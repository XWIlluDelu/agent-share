## Initial proposal (`refine-logs/round-0-initial-proposal.md`)

```markdown
# Research Proposal: [Title]

## Problem Anchor
- Bottom-line problem:
- Must-solve bottleneck:
- Non-goals:
- Constraints:
- Success condition:

## Technical Gap
[Why current methods fail, why naive bigger systems are not enough, and what mechanism is missing]

## Method Thesis
- One-sentence thesis:
- Why this is the smallest adequate intervention:
- Why this route is timely in the foundation-model era:

## Contribution Focus
- Dominant contribution:
- Optional supporting contribution:
- Explicit non-contributions:

## Proposed Method
### Complexity Budget
- Frozen / reused backbone:
- New trainable components:
- Tempting additions intentionally not used:

### System Overview
[Step-by-step pipeline or ASCII graph]

### Core Mechanism
- Input / output:
- Architecture or policy:
- Training signal / loss:
- Why this is the main novelty:

### Optional Supporting Component
- Only include if truly necessary:
- Input / output:
- Training signal / loss:
- Why it does not create contribution sprawl:

### Modern Primitive Usage
- Which LLM / VLM / Diffusion / RL-era primitive is used:
- Exact role in the pipeline:
- Why it is more natural than an old-school alternative:

### Integration into Base Generator / Downstream Pipeline
[Where the new method attaches, what is frozen, what is trainable, inference order]

### Training Plan
[Stagewise or joint training, losses, data construction, pseudo-labels, schedules]

### Failure Modes and Diagnostics
- [Failure mode]:
- [How to detect]:
- [Fallback or mitigation]:

### Novelty and Elegance Argument
[Closest work, exact difference, why this is a focused mechanism-level contribution rather than a module pile-up]

## Claim-Driven Validation Sketch
### Claim 1: [Main claim]
- Minimal experiment:
- Baselines / ablations:
- Metric:
- Expected evidence:

### Claim 2: [Optional]
- Minimal experiment:
- Baselines / ablations:
- Metric:
- Expected evidence:

## Experiment Handoff Inputs
- Must-prove claims:
- Must-run ablations:
- Critical datasets / metrics:
- Highest-risk assumptions:

## Compute & Timeline Estimate
- Estimated GPU-hours:
- Data / annotation cost:
- Timeline:
```

# Score Evolution

| Round | Problem Fidelity | Method Specificity | Contribution Quality | Frontier Leverage | Feasibility | Validation Focus | Venue Readiness | Overall | Verdict |
|-------|------------------|--------------------|----------------------|-------------------|-------------|------------------|-----------------|---------|---------|

## Round refinement (`refine-logs/round-N-refinement.md`)

```markdown
# Round N Refinement

## Problem Anchor
[Copy verbatim from round 0]

## Anchor Check
- Original bottleneck:
- Why the revised method still addresses it:
- Reviewer suggestions rejected as drift:

## Simplicity Check
- Dominant contribution after revision:
- Components removed or merged:
- Reviewer suggestions rejected as unnecessary complexity:
- Why the remaining mechanism is still the smallest adequate route:

## Changes Made

### 1. [Method section changed]
- Reviewer said:
- Action:
- Reasoning:
- Impact on core method:

### 2. [Novelty / modernity / feasibility / validation change]
- Reviewer said:
- Action:
- Reasoning:
- Impact on core method:

## Round-by-Round Resolution Log

| Round | Main Reviewer Concerns | What This Round Simplified / Modernized | Solved? | Remaining Risk |
|-------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------|----------------|
| 1     | [top issues from review] | [main method changes]                    | [yes / partial / no] | [if any] |
| 2     | ...                     | ...                                      | ...     | ...            |

## Overall Evolution
- [How the method became more concrete]
- [How the dominant contribution became more focused]
- [How unnecessary complexity was removed]
- [How modern technical leverage improved or stayed intentionally minimal]
- [How drift was avoided or corrected]

## Final Status
- Anchor status: [preserved / corrected / unresolved]
- Focus status: [tight / slightly broad / still diffuse]
- Modernity status: [appropriately frontier-aware / intentionally conservative / still old-school]
- Strongest parts of final method:
- Remaining weaknesses:

## Next Steps
- If READY: proceed to `/research-refine-pipeline` if you want the same proposal expanded into a full experiment roadmap, then `/run-experiment`
- If REVISE: manually address the remaining mechanism weaknesses, then re-run `/research-refine`
- If RETHINK: revisit the core mechanism, possibly with `/idea-creator`
